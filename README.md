## How NFT Marketplace Functions
* You need to create an NFT and specify all desired parameters (price, description, etc.).
* List your digital item for sale and wait till the moderation is completed.
* Then the auction takes place and buyers place their bids.
* Once the auction is finished, the transfer of digital product and cryptocurrency takes place. It is performed by an NFT marketplace. 

## Tech Stacks
To build our own custom NFT Marketplace, we are using following tech stacks -
* **Next.js** for front-end part of the solution;
* **Node.js + Express.js** for the back-end coding;
* **Github CI** for CI/Cd;
* **MongoDB** will be a perfect database for an NFT solution;
* **Vercel** is great for hosting and services.
